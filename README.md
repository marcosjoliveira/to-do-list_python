# To do list in *`Python`*
I made a to-do list, it was a personal project to training my programming skills.
This project was imaginated to show a menu that offer the user four options: Show tasks, Add tasks, Remove tasks and close program. The code has a problem in the 'Remove tasks' that the function cannot remove the tasks, despite this, the program works correclty.
